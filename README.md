### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andrei Dmitriev, a.k.a Brainstorm or Brainstorm4266

My Discord is Brainstorm#4266.
I'm a programmer for:
- TypeScript
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java
- C/C++
- Lua

If you refer to me, make sure to use she/him, or my name. I don't bite when somebody mistakes my pronouns, though.

Have a wonderful day!
